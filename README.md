# My process

## Built with
* Semantic HTML markup
* CSS custom properties

# What I learnt
In my first foray into responsive designs, it was quite some work in making sure the design was responsive and acts the same across different devices (somewhat responsive ü•≤)
Responsive designs cover a plethora of aspects however, from this project I have been aware of designs according to screen size and printers also.

## Continued Development
For further practice, this card will be made to be more responsive as the circle that houses the score isn't exactly a circle on some screens
